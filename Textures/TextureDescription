A file containing all of the texture data.

In the future, a loader could be included in the repository so that people could add their own textures.

The file size could be much smaller, but unfortunately a large image was used to texture most of the included .obj file.
This could be fixed in the future by redoing the uv map on the .obj file to use smaller tiled textures, but that is not a priority.

.lttex file format
COLOR PALETTE
      -256 colors, 3 bytes per color (all pixels use these colors)
 
COLOR GRADIENT
      -16384 colors, 1 byte per color (used to lighten and darken colors)

TEXTURE DATA (for each texture
      -Boolean flags:
          -1 byte
              -Scrolling, additive, no cull (triangles with additive textures brighten or darken triangles behind them.) (Triangles with the no cull flag are drawn on both sides.)
      -Texture width:
          -2 bytes
      -Texture height:
          -2 bytes
      -Pixel data:
          -1 byte per pixel (corresponding with a color in the color palette)
